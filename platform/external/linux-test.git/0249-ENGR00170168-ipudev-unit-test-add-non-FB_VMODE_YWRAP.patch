Subject: [PATCH 249/442] ENGR00170168 ipudev unit test: add non
 FB_VMODE_YWRAP support

when use pan display, the case could be:
1. a small window wrap in a big frame buffer
2. a frame switch in a serial buffers

the ipuv3 fb driver used to support case 1, and for case 2,
if the fb format is interleaved, there is no problem, but for
non-interleaved format (like I420), there will be a display bug.
