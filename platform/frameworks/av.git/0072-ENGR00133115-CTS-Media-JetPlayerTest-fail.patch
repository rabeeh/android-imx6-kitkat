Subject: [PATCH 72/72] ENGR00133115 CTS Media JetPlayerTest fail

After LoadFromFd test finished, same JetPlayer object is used in
following LoadFromPath test, but data in audioTrack from previous
test is not yet outputted completely, it affect second test and leads
to audioTrack->write() fail.
Add a workaround to let all data of first test be outputted.
