Subject: [PATCH 308/502] ENGR00216843 testPreviewFpsRange failed in DL with
 25% possibility

The case need strict frame interval time according the fps setting
The failure case is caused by some time there is not buffer in ready_q
queue in mxc_v4l_capture driver.
The buffer location is as below:
two buffers in Surfaceflinger, one for composition, the other is in ready queue
one buffer in driver's working_q for csi interrupt handling
one buffer in driver's done_q, which can be dequeue by Camera HAL
one buffer in Camera HAL, which just dequeued from v4l driver, and not queue
to SurfaceFlinger yet
mxc v4l capture driver need ready_q have at least one buffer at any time of
irq handler
if not, there next irq will only update the dummy buffer
