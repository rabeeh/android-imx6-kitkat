Subject: [PATCH 289/310] ENGR00299781 - testExternalStorageGifts, xxxNone,
 xxxRead fail

kk4.4 support multi-user, external storage for apk is under
"/storage/emulated/uid". For example, if root, then under
"/storage/emulated/0".

sdcard process need add -l option to support DERIVE_LEGACY.
Below is comments from system/core/sdcard/sdcard.c
/* Legacy behavior used to support internal multiuser layout which
 * places user_id at the top directory level, with the actual roots
 * just below that. Shared OBB path is also at top level. */
